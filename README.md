# Open-Data-Baltimore
Visualization Webapp for some Open Data Baltimore data sets 

How I built and designed this project:


# How to run
 1. First install Node Program Manager @ https://www.npmjs.com/
 2. Download the file system and run the following commands.
```text
> npm install
> npm start
```

This will start a local webserver pointed at http://localhost:8000/

Your app runs on [http://localhost:8000/app](http://localhost:8000/app)
